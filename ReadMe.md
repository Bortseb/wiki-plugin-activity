# Federated Wiki (experimental) - Activity Plugin

*This federated wiki plugin is part of an experimental code refactoring, which is very much a work in progress. See [WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki) (ruby), or [WardCunningham/wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/wiki) (node), for the current stable versions.*

The Activity plugin lists pages in your neighborhood. It expand as your neighborhood grows. 
Page names used on multiple sites are grouped together with the most current site listed first.
